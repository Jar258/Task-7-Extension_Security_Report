Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

Objective:
To identify, evaluate, and remove suspicious or unnecessary Chrome browser extensions to enhance security and browser performance.

Steps Taken:
Browser Used:
 Google Chrome (Version: Latest on Windows laptop)

2. Reviewed Extensions:
 Extension Name             Status          Notes                                                                 

Grammarly                    Kept         Trusted and useful, permissions limited to text editing.             
Dark Reader                  Kept         Open-source, privacy-friendly, only changes website appearance.      
Fake Email Generator         Removed      Found suspicious: Used temporary emails, collected browser data.     
Weather Now                  Removed      Unnecessary, accessed location and tabs, not from trusted developer.  
PDFConverterSearch           Removed      Poor reviews, requested excessive permissions, possibly adware.      
Honey                        Kept         Reputable, used for discount codes, limited permissions.              

Suspicious Extensions Removed:

1. Fake Email Generator
   - Permission: Access to all websites, storage, and tabs.
   - Reason: Installed without remembering; found to track data in background.
   - Action: Removed immediately.

2. Weather Now
   - Permission: Full access to browsing activity and location.
   - Reason: Not essential; could track and sell location data.

3. PDFConverterSearch
   - Permission: Read/change all data on websites.
   - Reason: Poor ratings, flagged as potentially unwanted program (PUP).

After Cleanup:
- Restarted Chrome.
- Checked performance — browser now loads faster with fewer background tasks.

What I Learned:

- Many extensions ask for more permissions than needed, especially free utilities.
- Even “simple” extensions can track your activity or inject ads.
- Reviewing permissions, developer credibility, and reviews is crucial.
- Extensions like **"temporary email creators"** and **"PDF tools"** are often used for phishing or adware distribution.

Key Security Concepts Applied:

- Extension Sandboxing: Isolates extension activity from the main browser.
- Permission Awareness: Avoided installing extensions with access to “All your data.”
- Malicious Extension Detection: Identified fake utilities disguised as helpful tools.
- Safe Practices: Only kept extensions from trusted developers.
